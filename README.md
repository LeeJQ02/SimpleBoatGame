# Boat Race Game

This is a simple implementation of the "Boat Race" game in Java. The game follows the rules outlined below and is designed with object-oriented principles for maintainability and reusability.

## Game Rules

- **Players:** The game is designed for two players, each with their boat.
- **Starting Position:** At the beginning of the game, each player is allocated a boat.
- **Gameplay:** Players take turns rolling a dice to determine how many steps their boat should move forward.
- **River:** The river is visualized as a 100-column track filled with random traps(#) and currents(C).
- **Effects of Traps and Currents:** Traps and currents affect the boat's movement. Stronger traps or currents cause boats to move more steps backward or forward.
- **Boundary Limits:** Boats cannot move beyond the river's boundaries.
- **Game End:** The game ends when one player's boat reaches the end of the river.
- **High Scores:** Players are asked for their names at the start of the game, and their scores are stored in 'TopScore.txt' if they make it to the top 5 scores.
